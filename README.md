### Technologies
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Express
* CORS
* Axios
* JSON

### Features
*1. Display and clear numbers*
* Users can display numbers and mathematical operators by clicking on the corresponding calculator buttons, or by clicking on the display screen and typing.
* Users can clear the display screen entirely and start over by clicking on the "clear" button.

*2. Make calculations*
* After a mathematical equation has been entered into the display screen (ex: "2+2"), users can click on the "=" button in order to see the answer to their equation. The equation will be removed from the display screen, and the answer will be put in its place.
* Users can build upon previous calculations. This means that if "4" is returned from "2+2," users can subsequently use "+," "-," "x," or "/" to perform a new calculation with the returned value ("4"). Alternatively, users can clear the screen to start over.

*3. Change your theme*
* When users click on the "Transport yourself!" button, the app's theme is randomly changed. There are 4 different themes: pink, blue, green, and orange, each representing different galaxies.
